                <p>
                    I really like a Japanese manga called Sumikko Gurashi, and my favorite character was the Shirokuma (the Polar Bear). During one of my trips, I found and bought this Polar Bear plush in a store. Since then, it travelled with me to many cities. Now, I’m selling it and hope it can create more memories with someone else.

                   This is a set of clips that I used to organize my study materials. The texture is really nice and they look cute. Since I switched to take notes on my ipad, I didn’t use them much anymore. I hope they can accompany their next owner in recording new chapters of life.

                        This bunny plush was a gift from my friend back in high school. We loved this brand at the time. I took it with me to university, and it’s been with me through many new experiences: new friendships, moving dorms etc. Now it’s time for it to meet a new owner. I hope it brings you a bit of happiness too!

                       This cute cat from the Sylvanian Families used to sit on my desk while I studied. I bought it last Halloween at a store in the UK since it is so festive at the time. Halloween is coming again, and I thought it would be nice to let it find a new home and bring someone else that same festival feeling.

                        These three Sylvanian Families figures were bought online and arrived just a day before I moved to a new city for school, so I took them with me. I even placed them inside my lightstick and brought them to a concert. I hope they can continue their journey with someone new.

                       This Sylvanian Families figure was a birthday gift from a friend. It used to mean a lot to me, but we’re no longer in touch. So I decided to let it go. Hope it brings someone else a true and lasting friendship!

                       I really like Sanrio, and I also really like the Naruto. So when they released a collaboration, I bought it. This is my favorite character and I bought two at the time (no regrets). Now I’m selling it. Hope it finds someone who loves this series as much as I do!!!

                        I bought it at a Sylvanian-themed café during a trip. There was even a rule of purchasing: you had to order a drink from the café to get the access of buying it. I ordered an apple smoothie that day and it tasted so refreshing during the hot day. The only problem was that I couldn’t find a trash bin afterward to throw the empty cup away. Anyway, I hope another Sylvanian fan like me will take this little one home!

                       This little hat is special because it’s handmade. I was learning how to crochet at that time, and my grandma and I made a lot of hats like this one. I think crocheting is very interesting. However, we have way too many handmade items at home, so I decided to sell a few. If you like crocheting too, feel free to reach out to me!
